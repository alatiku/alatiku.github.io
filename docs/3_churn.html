<h1>Analysis Objectives</h1>
<p>The purpose of this analysis is to answer 5 business questions using
the Telco Customer Churn - IBM Dataset.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What are the main factors contributing to customer
churn?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we identify patterns or behaviors that precede customer
churn?</p></li>
<li><p>Which customer segments have the highest churn rates?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there specific products or services associated with higher
churn rates?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we predict which customers are likely to churn in the near
future?</p></li>

<p>1869 customers out of which 790 are high value customers have
churned. A churn rate of 22.4% for high value customers and overall
churn rate of 26.5% for all customers, both are considerably high.</p>
<p>Next, it is important to find which variables have high correlation
with churn.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Correlation matrix

variables.Tenure Months and Total Charges have the strongest
relationship, but other relationships do exists, which should help in
the analysis.</p>

<p>The Random Forest model provides insight to those variables that

analyze some of these key predictors that strongly influence customer
churn.</p>

<h3>2. Can we identify patterns or behaviors that precede customer
churn?</h3>
<p>To do that, the data needs to only include churned customers, then
further analysis could identify which factors are unique to them.
Specifically, we look at those variable that are high on the random
forest model.</p>

<p>Looking at the charts above, we can deduce that most customers who
churn have a month-to-month contract and tend to stay for short periods
because the tenure distribution is right-skewed, they also subscribed to
the fibre-optic internet service and chose to pay by electronic check.
These are certainly behaviors that could be used to track churning.</p>

<p>The charts above show the services that have high churn rates.
Customers that don’t subscribe to have Online Security, tech support and
those that subscribe to have paperless billing are more likely to churn.
By addressing customer pain points associated with these services, the
rate of churn could be reduced overall, as well as increasing customer
satisfaction.</p>

<h4>Therefore, in order to predict which customers will churn in the

</div>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The analysis couldn’t consider the customer reasons for churning
due to the high proportion of missing values for that variable, and as
such, the insights into the specific motivations or pain points driving
churn remain limited. This missing information could potentially lead to
an incomplete understanding of the underlying factors contributing to
customer attrition and might hinder the development of targeted
strategies to address these issues effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>While the analysis identifies correlations between the variables
and churn, it is important to remember correlation isn’t causation, and
therefore a lot of other factors could be responsible for churn. For
example, the data does not consider temporal trends that could affect
churn rates over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Logistic regression and decision tree models make certain
assumptions about data distribution and relationships, and any violation
of these assumptions could affect the validity of the analysis.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It is important to improve customer retention strategies that
target the specific customers with high churn rate through personalized
communication, improved customer service and ensuring the quality and
reliability of services, leading to an improved customer satisfaction
rate which could result in a low churn rate.</p></li>
<li><p>The Offering of loyalty programs such as rewards, discounts, and
exclusive benefits to long-term customers can incentivize them to stay
and continue using your products or service, while also setting
competitive prices that are affordable can influence customers’ to
stay.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing an early warning systems such as a predictive model
that can identify customers at risk of churning, to allow proactive
interventions to prevent churn. This could also be achieve with a strong
customer feedback system that offer suggestions on improvements and pain
points.</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to implement an exit survey conducted for churned
customers to include not only reasons for leaving, but also customer
satisfaction ratings on services can provide insights into why they
left, to guide strategies to address common pain points.</p></li>
