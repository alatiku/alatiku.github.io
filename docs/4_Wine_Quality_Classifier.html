<h2>Wine Quality Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset consists of physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the
output) variables for two datasets, the red and white variants of the
Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. The two data sets could be used for the
analysis, but only one at a time.</p>
<p>The dataset is available on <a
href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality">UCI Machine
Learning Repository</a>. The data has the following columns and their
descriptions:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It might be possible to increase the ‘Accuracy’, ‘Precision’ and
‘Recall’ of the RandomForest model through hyper-parameter tuning. This
will enable the efficient use of the parameters in the RandomForest
model.</p></li>
<li><p>The ensemble model, AdaBoost model, produced good ‘Accuracy’,
‘Precision’ and ‘Recall’ but there might be still room for improvement.
This could also be improved using hyper-parameter tuning or more feature
engineering such as PCA or scaling.</p></li>
<li><p>Both the red-wine and white-wine data sets showed tremendous
improvement using the ensembled model compared to the RandomForests
model, which indicates this might be the best model for this
task.</p></li>
