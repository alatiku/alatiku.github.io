<h3>After dedicatting a year refining my R skills through immersive
courses, notably on DataCamp. In July 2023, I revisited the Cyclistic
project to apply my enhanced abilities.</h3>
<p>This case study focuses on analyzing the bike-share program of
Cyclistic, a company in Chicago, with the goal of understanding the
differences between annual members and casual riders. The objective is
to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. The analysis will leverage Cyclistic’s historical trip data and
explore various trends and patterns.</p>

<div id="limitations-on-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Limitations on analysis</h1>
<p>The analysis of the bike data was hindered by missing data and
information. Several columns, including start station names, end
station, and station IDs, contained missing data, impacting the accuracy
of the findings. Moreover, the absence of age and gender information for
the riders limited the understanding of their influence on bike usage
and hindered targeted marketing efforts. These limitations might have
result in an incomplete representation of bike usage patterns,
preventing the identification of preferences and usage patterns among
different demographic groups.</p>
<p>To address these issues in future research, techniques for imputing
missing data could be applied, and efforts to collect additional data on
age and gender information should be implemented. By mitigating these
limitations, future analyses would offer more comprehensive insights
into bike usage and enable more effective targeting strategies based on
demographic characteristics.</p>
</div>
<div id="recommendations" class="section level1">
<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Run specific campaigns targeting casual riders at the stations
during weekends, and evening peak periods during the weekdays.</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing campaigns to get casual riders to become annual members
should run more during the summer months, and specifically during the
months of June, July and August when Casual riders show more
activeness.</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing campaigns could showcase the essence of becoming
members by highlighting the exclusive benefits that members receive,
such as significant discounts on longer rides.</p></li>
