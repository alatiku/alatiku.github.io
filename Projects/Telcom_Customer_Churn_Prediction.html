<p>Note: Data has 2 variables with missing values.</p>
<p>The variable ‘Churn Reason’ has a high proportion of missing values, 73.46% and will be dropped from the data, while the variable ‘Total Charges’ will be imputed with the mean value because it has less than 0.15% missing to avoid dropping any rows.</p>
<p>Imputing by the mean on a small number of missing values (11 rows to be precise) will not skew the data.</p>

<p>The Telco data undergoes thorough cleaning: unnecessary variables are dropped, columns are renamed using underscores instead of spaces for clarity, missing values in ‘Total_Charges’ are imputed with the mean value, categorical variables are converted to factors, and binary variables are encoded as 1s and 0s.</p>
<p>CustomerID is removed because it doesn’t provide insights into churning behavior. Count, Country, State, and City are eliminated due to their lack of variation in values. The column “Lat Long” is discarded because it duplicates information found in the Latitude and Longitude columns. “Churn Value” is removed as it replicates the information in the Churn Label column. Finally, “Churn Reason” is excluded due to a high proportion of missing values.</p>

<h1>Exploratory Analysis</h1>
<p>To take advantage of the geospatial information present in the Telco data, it will be beneficial to visualize the churn data on a map before analysis. This can help identify clusters of high or low churn rates, revealing regional patterns in customer behavior or service quality, thus providing valuable insights.</p>

<p>Customers that don’t subscribe to Online Security, tech support and those that subscribe to have paperless billing are more likely to churn. By addressing customer pain points associated with these services, the rate of churn could be reduced.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-we-predict-which-customers-are-likely-to-churn-in-the-near-future">Can we predict which customers are likely to churn in the near future?</h3>
<p>To predict customer churn, machine learning algorithms will be employed. Due to the nature of the data, a logistic regression model and a classification decision tree model will be constructed and assessed to determine the most best algorithm for the task.</p>

<p>The Gain chart and the Decision Tree Model Performance of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Accuracy of 55.3%,</p></li>
<li><p>Precision of 5%, and</p></li>
<li><p>Recall of 11.2%,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>all combine to indicate a poor and unacceptable performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to predict which customers will churn in the feature, the logistic regression model is the model of choice.</p>
<hr>
</section>
</section>
<section id="limitation" class="level1">
<h1>Limitation</h1>
<p>The analysis couldn’t explore customer reasons for churning due to the high proportion of missing values for that variable, and as such, the insights into the specific motivations or pain points driving churn remain limited. This missing information could potentially lead to an incomplete understanding of the underlying factors contributing to customer attrition and might hinder the development of targeted strategies to address these issues effectively.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is important to improve customer retention strategies that target the specific customers with high churn rate through personalized communication, improved customer service and ensuring the quality and reliability of services, leading to an improved customer satisfaction rate which could result in a low churn rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Offering loyalty programs, such as rewards, discounts, and exclusive benefits, to new customers can incentivize them to remain engaged and continue utilizing products and services.</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to implement an exit survey conducted for churned customers to include not only reasons for leaving, but also customer satisfaction ratings on services, which can provide insights into why they left, to guide strategies to address common pain points.</p></li>
