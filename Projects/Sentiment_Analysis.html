The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.","Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \"Jumbo\".","This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.","If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.","Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.","I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.","This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!","This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!","Right now I'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too","This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.","I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the personal, incredible service!","One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week.","My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat.","good flavor! these came securely packed... they were fresh and delicious! i love these Twizzlers!","The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I.","My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It's exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers.","I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies! It is not too sweet. I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them.","I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more.","Twizzlers, Strawberry my childhood favorite candy, made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y &amp; S Candies, Inc. one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States, now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company, the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie, they also make Apple Licorice Twists, Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists, I like them all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest Licorice Twist ever made measured 1.200 Feet (370 M) and weighted 100 Pounds (45 Kg) and was made by Y &amp; S Candies, Inc. This Record-Breaking Twist became a Guinness World Record on July 19, 1998. This Product is Kosher! Thank You","Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.","My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner.","I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.&lt;br /&gt;There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM\"&gt;Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt;","I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn't dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won't be disappointed with.","I love this candy.  After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it.","I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!&lt;br /&gt;Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I'm able to buy them right now.","Product received is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM\"&gt;Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt;","The candy is just red , No flavor . Just  plan and chewy .  I would never buy them again","I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal for the price.","I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she's the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that they're sugar-free and it's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that i've ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets.&lt;br /&gt;These are just EXCELLENT!","I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the personal, incredible service!","I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).&lt;br /&gt;The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I'am getting one myself! :)","This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staral","McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.","This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.","Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)","McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a fan of the McCann's steel-cut oats, so I thought I'd give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won't make you bloat.","For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann's instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Abby","What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It's still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!","I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL .) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE ,IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN .

At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...","McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.&lt;br /&gt;  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples &amp; Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.&lt;br /&gt;  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.","I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy","McCann's Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent.","We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often.&lt;br /&gt;This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.","This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again.","Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.","The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy.","I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety. I'll get all Maple and Brown Sugar.","This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.","This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don't like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.","Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not \"burn your mouth forever hot\"  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us..","This wasn't in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin' Peanuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I'm not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. He'll be so insulted.","we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.","I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively.","We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much.","Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.","It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more.","Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies!","Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many.","Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was&lt;br /&gt;$3-4 less at Target.","This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy","Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!","I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \"salty\" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.","This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.&lt;br /&gt;I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.","This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.","For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The \"zero carb\" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....","I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.","If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping).","this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault","These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed!","Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!","I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed.","Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea &amp; headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!","It is okay.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again","No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.","These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up.","These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!","The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor.","i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp.","This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I'm 30 now and I love it!","Great gift for all ages! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them.","I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.","While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients.","Awesome dog food. However, when given to my \"Boston\", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching. As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet.","We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping.","My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won't cause her pain.","My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!","Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.","Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages &amp; breeds. Ît's a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!","I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance.","This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him.","This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :)","My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.","This is the same food we get at pet store. But it's delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less.","I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.","My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more \"bang for your buck\" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!","Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods.

The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef).","I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it.

My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them.  They are just too sour/tart for my taste.  I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling.  My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me.","These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are!","What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.","I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more!","not what I was expecting in terms of the company's reputation for excellent home delivery products","I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one. They wont go to waste!","I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn't believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I've got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!!","I'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson","I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one.","I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.","I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays \"CAFFENE FREE\".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.","this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it's clean, bright, fresh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great delivery...again quality... just try it...","I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!","I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try.","I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again.","In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids!","I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.","I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his \"spunk\" so I decided it was time to start buying him \"real\" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!","I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.","This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.","I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.","Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&amp;Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.","My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!","One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also.","Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!","I've been a fan of Hot &amp; Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product. Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon. It's only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart.","I've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I've never found a better flavor than Hot &amp; Spicy Chicken!  It isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!","I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon.","Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in.","I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.","I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.","Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale.","i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon","I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store.","The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)","Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.","I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down.","My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it!","I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.","Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.&lt;br /&gt;If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h it's a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there","I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.&lt;br /&gt;Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!!","If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!","I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.","Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!","The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little \"stuffing\" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found \"none\" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF \"STUFF\" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS&lt;br /&gt;ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S.","This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money.","These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.","This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor.","This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor &amp; flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it!","Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores","Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself.  It actually tastes pretty good.","These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy.","AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.","I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn't find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy!","What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.","Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely.","&lt;span class=\"tiny\"&gt; Length:: 0:26 Mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.&lt;br /&gt;edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna.&lt;br /&gt;I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway.","I've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning.","these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato","I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me.","I'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like it's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. It's better than something plain but it didn't pack the punch I was hoping for. It's still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal.","I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe a little heating brings out the flavor.","Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.","I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)","Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff!","I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away.","Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency.  Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts...nor do they even taste good.  Yucky stuff.  Trying to return with vendor.","The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope.","I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag.","I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.&lt;br /&gt;It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,&lt;br /&gt;and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring&lt;br /&gt;back. Check it out.","I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product!","I couldn't wait to try the 8&amp;#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&amp;#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really \"takes the cake\" with size, price, quality and taste.&lt;br /&gt;The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!","I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago. This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.","One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying it.","This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again and again.","Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with.","This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice!","Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff.","I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for $4.00 a case of tweleve not paying $38.00 Yes 3 for a dollar. I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price.","This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING!","WE have been looking for \"natural\" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule. Yes, we'd probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice. This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me. After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome.","We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.","This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town.","We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores.","This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.","My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone. The smell is kinda strong, but not bad. It's tolerablel.","I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants.  I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does!  I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it.  My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee.  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks.  :)","The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again.  There is just a slight \"vitaminy\" taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's also a bit pricey for what you get.","This coffee is great because it's all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma.","Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste. I've tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones. Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is 'Africafe pure instant coffee'","Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging.","These little guys are tasty and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers!","I like these better than the regular Altoids, but they're even more costly, so you'd better like them.","These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal.There perfict for on the go.Fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary along.And there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugar.The price of twelve dollars was very resonable.Also there great for shareing.If you are looking for a mint try these ones.Youll be glad you did.","Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+packaging, shipping, price&lt;br /&gt;+sold about a year before its expiration date (enough for me to eat/share 9 boxes)&lt;br /&gt;+not too \"fresh\" like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form. it's a real mint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none!","Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day, as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE!!! LOLOLOL!!!","These mints are really strong and have a great taste. They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse.","This is a huge supply of them. I'm still working on these and have plenty to spare. Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint.","Even with small containers, they don't fill them up.  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?  Or how about the cereal ploy, they were filled at the factory but settled in transport.&lt;br /&gt;Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings?","I love, and use the empty containers for medicine/advil in my purse, desk, suitcase. Also line with felt to keep earrings. Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints. Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth.","Received as shown. My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them. It was great i could get them on Amazon.","I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to. Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet. When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn't make it easy to deal with).","The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability. It's full, but compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't run out yet, and probably won't for a couple months, but I can't wait to buy it again.","I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much, I had to come write a review. The packaging is small for convenience, and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape, blue hue, and even more delicious taste in my opinion. I definitely prefer them over the regular-size Altoids and will continue purchasing them! Highly recommended!","Fresh scent and taste. Easy to eat one tin in few hours. I use them as favors and everyone loved them.","Hard to find the wintergreen smalls [sugar free] as stores only have the red smalls [peppermint --such a common flavor]. The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious. Driving cross country, if someone cuts me off, I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say \"Wintergreen Me!\" She pulls one out, puts it in my hand, and all is right with the world.","To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints. They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and that's as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints.","we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:&lt;br /&gt;After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.","I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it. Clearly, mine does.","We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we'd give it a try for our cats.  I'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really \"feeling better\" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it'll be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.","Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down. What a mess. We've moved on.","As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!","Don't buy just a few of these!  I order these by the case.  I can't even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite.","I order these olives a lot. They are un-like any other olives out there. The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses. One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests.","Hey, the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $4.00 per can. No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can.","My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more.","A friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago. Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound. At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think it's great. I've been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc. Most of them were over $30/lb. with shipping. Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest. Has everything I'm looking for in a strong, full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring. My current favorite afternoon tea. Unless you're extremely jaded or a tea snob, you'll love it.","I love strong, full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam, irish breakfast or early grey tea, but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging. So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasn't bitter at a more palatable price point, and this certainly fits the bill. And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another, i.e. iced vs. hot, this tea is excellent in both forms. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesn't cost an arm and leg.","I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store.  One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma.  So the label \"Imperial Blend\" kind of implied the herb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not exactly a black tea drinker, so this tea is a surprise, and affordable too.  I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature water.  But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the 'softness' of white tea.","I've tried a variety of Ahmad tea. Not because I particularly like this brand, but they are just easier to come across.  The Imperial blend, I believe, is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I've tried. It's full body like a good cup of Assam, which by no means overpower the delightful, clean taste of Darjeerling, complete with a long lasting note of bergamot. I enjoy it best in the evening. It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication.","I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.  I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly. My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too.","This is an excellent tea.  One of the best I have ever had.  It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar.","Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste. It is only for people who like herbal taste. I don't.","Makes a tasty, super easy meal, fast. BUT high in calories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first. The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess. I made it with snow peas and carrots only. I dont like the little corn.  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice.  It came out wonderful! Dinner on the table in less than 30mins.","I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other.  Most have too much sugar or worst, corn syrup.  This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty. It does have a little kick. Enjoy.","Might be a little spicy for some, but this stuff rocks. I use 1/2 and1/2 with V8 for a milder version , or the best is a Bloody Caesar!&lt;br /&gt;Half mix ,half clamato!","Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste.  But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand","This candy is not as described. The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described.&lt;br /&gt;Looks and tastes like it's way past it's expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;Would never reccommend this. Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing","I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings. Since I liked it so well, I tried some of the others and I am now hooked!  They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time.  The Energy gives you that extra pick-me-up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day, no matter how long.","I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. I'll be coming back to this one.","i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does.  just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience.","Terrible! Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish. Don't do this to yourself. Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest.","These things are huge! I love the way the crystals crunch, and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle. This lemony flavor is my favorite--it's good on almost everything. You'll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this.","The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2\" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little&lt;br /&gt;more bang for your buck and have more flavor.","This is the ultimate puppy food.  The kibbles are great for small breeds.  High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use.  Less waste results from the high quality ingredients.  I have been hunting, training, showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years, with multiple National Champions.  I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods.  My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON.com.  Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock.","The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.","A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend.","Fresh,a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories. They taste just like chocolate pudding.","If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good (cheaper than I can find locally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This listing's description is confusing. Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams, which equals 1.1 pounds or 17.6 ounces.","I've been enjoying this tea for years.  This tea is good mornings, afternoons or evenings.  My local store went out of buisiness....Thanks Amazon!  I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot.","Hi, I have to have black tea everyday. I have done it in the past 25 years and it's a habit of mine. Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea. I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so :)","I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries.","Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea. Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste.","I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.&lt;br /&gt;This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse.","I love love love this deal - it's way fun to pick from so many! Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees. The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring - they do the choosing, and from a much narrower range. The sellers here are very nice, also, and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method (it's easy). If you want great packaging, forget it - they ship fast, and the kups are just tossed loose in a box. Who cares?","Once you've tried some random sampler packs (and now are overloaded with decafs,extra bolds, or teas), this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want.  Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered.  This was my second order and I'll be ordering this item again.","good products and fast shipping equals a happy me. a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors...a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price","If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack.","WOW!  This product is very impressive. I bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging, price and shipping.  The powder dissolves instantly.  Even in water!  I've just been mixing a 1/4 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great!, but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next. This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries, especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away.  I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well.  I'm excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way. I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon.","The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.","Five minutes in, one tentacle was bitten off, ball inside cracked in half. Not durable enough to be a dog toy. Disappointed :(. So is the dog :(.","I am chemical sensitive as well as sugar-free. I have been using this product for over a year. I use it maybe once a week at the most. I drink 1/2 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel. IMO this doesn't replace my a.m. coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade. Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout. I've been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years. Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this. This product is clean and doesn't leave nasty chems behind in the body. Try it before you judge from a review - everyone's body reacts differently.","I felt energized within five minutes, but it lasted for about 45 minutes. I paid $3.99 for this drink. I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money.","Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!","These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect. Although I wasn't sure about the peanut butter bar, it was excellent. I loved the Roasted Almond, Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definately buy from this seller again. Quick shipping and very fresh.","I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership.","This product has a strong after-taste of Crayola crayons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes.  Upon opening the plastic container, the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room, and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date, my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans.  The flavor is fantastic.  However, they do not supply a gallon-sized tub,and Dr. Mercola has the best product in that size category.","Had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten-free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets. Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs.  Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking, too. Good product, good value.","These are healthy and my mixed Llasa, Tibetan Terrier adores them. And they are healthy and his breath doesn't smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products. A great healthy product.","A great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle, Rio. He loves the taste and it sure beats my arm.","I really enjoy this product. I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store. Once I found it I look no further, it's the only sugar I use.  Thanks so much.","I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years, after being introduced to it in a Starbucks. My most recent purchase, however, was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a \"1\" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a \"51A\"). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, I'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw.","\"Sugar in the Raw\"(tm) Please Harvest Cane w/o Burning&lt;br /&gt;To be delivered to: HC&amp;S&lt;br /&gt;Dear \"Sugar in the Raw\" folks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We who buy your product care about the environment. And we'd like to know that you care too. When you burn the cane fields on Maui, it adds to the CO2 and worsens climate change. And the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers, your workers' children and the residents of Maui.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love your product and want you to change to no-burn harvesting so we can continue to buy it, knowing we aren't contributing to Global Warming and lung disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]","Love this sugar.  I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar. Recommend!","Product is exactly as advertised.  What a savings!  At least half the retail price. Easy to store because of the individual packaging.","I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.","It's just sugar in the raw, it's flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it's suppose to be better for you or something. I just wish the bags were resealable.","This is a delicious sugar. It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer.","I only use raw sugar, it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good. Will buy again.","This sugar is very good.  Use this in your coffee, cereal, etc for a week and you'll never go back to white sugar, white sugar will taste terrible.  Plus from what I've read, this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered fast and well-packaged.  My only complaint is the price.  I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper.  I would be happy to buy in bulk, but this is the cheapest I have found.","I thought this was a great buy, but as noted by Scott D., the molasses content was not up to par.  I loved the higher molasses content \"Sugar in the Raw\".  Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags.  I guess I'll watch for the next crop.","I really love this sugar and price-wise it's much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else.","Love this sugar. It tastes so much better and isn't as overly sweet tasting as \"regular\" sugar. We've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good. The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff.","Can't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw.  I like it better than the other \"natural\" sugars. Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the \"natural\" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.  It didn't look like the box was damaged so I can't tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.  Not sure what the solution is and I'd order it again, but if it happens again, I'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag.","Great service! Items arrived faster than expected. Very efficient! Will use this seller again. I highly recommend this seller! Thank you for the excellent service!","Please ignore the one-star comments, if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower. With anything that is gluten free you have to add another \"binder\" which is where the corn flour comes in. For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips, because they contain wheat (a key binder to any chip, cookie or cereal) this is an excellent product. My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious!","Best flavor ever!  I'm addicted!  They are all good but these are by far the best.  I could live on these!  And there is no need for anymore to say....","So many \"healthy\" products don't taste very good.  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill.  I've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty.  I've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them. It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway.","I found these crisps at our local WalMart &amp; figured I would give them a try. They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips, not that I was a big chip fan anyway. The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting. I give these crisps a big thumbs up!","This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten! I only buy it on special occassions because I know I'll eat the whole bag.","I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a \"good\" carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have \"Masa corn flour\" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste.","I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so much--it saves me on a daily basis.  If you're trying to cook lower fat, healthier foods and in a HURRY, this stuff makes it so much easier.  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird \"tin can\" taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever?  For some reason this product doesn't have that.  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans, heat and eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup.  I also make indian dishes with this, and spicey spaghetti sauce.  I also prefer this to most canned salsas, so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of my local grocery stores carry it at all, nor do they carry anything like it.  So I have to pay Amazon's inflated price to order this by the case.  I don't like that I'm paying a higher price, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product.","the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores. i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for $1. dissapointing!","howdy y'all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the actual product is VERY good - i'd rate the item a 4 on it's own. however, it's only ONE dollar at the local grocery and - @ twenty eight+ dollars per twelve pack - these are running almost two and a half dollars each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as i said, TOO EXPENSIVE. [*sigh ...*] i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take care,&lt;br /&gt;lee","Nothing wrong with the product, but I sure had to mix it with *lots* of other ingredients to make it edible to me. (In Texas I was called a \"baby-mouth\" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though.","This is a fantastic product, and I wish it was readily available in most stores. It's taste is not the greatest, but it's a 2.5 oz. shot, and it's gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results.","I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon. I was drinking one 5 hour energy, usually extra strength, each day. It worked well, but gave me a jittery feeling, almost headachy but not quite. My husband got me to try this and I was skeptical, but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesn't give me that jittery almost-headache feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't mind the taste--it reminds me of the inside of a fig newton (mmm). And the price is ok, on Amazon anyway. At my grocery store they were almost $3 each, yike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it's organic--so I can feel good about it, right? It's all about me feeling good!","I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there. He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day. Good stuff!","I am a energy junkie and I'm not sure if this works or not, but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest. I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results. I like this products because it is  more natural then the others.","If you want an organic energy shot, your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki. Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks, and they both use Sambazon Acai, so there are some similarities in ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great energy burst for 4+ hours on a Steaz Energy Shot, and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards. Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work. This will help me cut down on my iced coffees, which are not helping my calorie intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already ordering 12-packs on subscribe and save, 2 per month. Great value.","I was looking for a natural energy shot that works, and I found it. Steaz energy shot is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had gastric bypass surgery, so tons of sugar is a no-no. And I'm also allergic to Sucralose (Splenda) so most other energy drinks are out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Bazi energy shots and they didn't work as well as Steaz, and definitely didn't taste as well. These have a taste that's almost like Coca-Cola--not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're looking for natural energy, give these a try.","I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I don't like the taste of either of them! This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better. I like them cold for sure. My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we don't have to make stops for coffee! Especially on the turnpikes where it's just way too expensive. It's worth the $[...] per shot. We normally split them. I'm really sensitive to caffeine, even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that's the same for coffee too for me. My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost. I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there. You can feel good about putting this in your body! I'll be ordering again soon for sure =)","I purchased it because it was on sale. In terms of the energy it provides, it works, but the taste leaves something to be desired. I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable.","I've been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon. As a software engineer, this is entirely unacceptable! So, I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market, for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle. Over three hours after drinking whatever that was, my brain is still working at unnatural speeds. To summarize my experiences: I believe this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it, which I personally feel helped the energy level. So if you're feeling tired during the day and hate coffee, give this a shot - preferably before you eat anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woot!","The energy shot truly does work! It had a terrible after-taste at first, but now that I know what to expect, I am getting used to it. I always have some water handy as a chaser...which helps! I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages. It's helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartame-laced caffeinated beverages. Yay!!!","I've tried 5-hour energy, red rain, NOS, and other energy shots.  This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect.  Plus, it's somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used.  Sometimes I wonder what I'm really putting into my body with some of the other brands.  I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years.","If you're looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals, this is a great option.  The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters.","I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market. I bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. I fell in love instantly. The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price. I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon. I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product, hah!","I have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all, its also the best taste, others taste like medicine, this one has a tea fresh taste. I love it.","I drive OTR...Over the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert. It has no sugar high &amp; no crash. I'm on a autoship which i like. The price is very good. I've seen it over 2 bucks in the store.","Products takes pretty good, and it doesn't leave you gittery.  With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below $ 2 a shot.  My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style.  I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink.","I use this product daily, and it provides a steady stream of energy.  I do not get jittery or crash.  It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant.","I've been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, ~6-hour effect. The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps I'm getting more used to it. I don't drink it for the flavor, but it's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, non-organic energy shots.","This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail","I loved this mold!  I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion, but it didn't last.  I did use it to make 30+ suckers for my daughter's first birthday. But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that.  I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions, but for the price it didn't matter to me that much.  It served it's main purpose :)","You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls!  The regular chocolate ones are good, but THESE are the BEST EVER!!","Try this you might like it. I did and I am quite addicted, it is too easy to prepare, it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with. The price is really good and well worth the purchase. If you like this type of Couscous like I do, then give this one a try.It can be eaten hot, room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors, it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed. I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time. I will be back for more.","This tri-color couscous is really good...full of flavor and fun to eat.  I love the texture.  I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro,) along with some red pepper flakes.  At the end of cooking, I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish...Highly recommend","I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck.  So I decided to try good ole Amazon.com and selected this product.  It is so good..add a few herbs and it's a great side dish, or add more and make a \"pasta type\" salad.so very good.  I am hooked.  Great flavor and so easy to prepare!","The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions. I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit, covered for 5min. It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container.","I wouldn't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit. How can I compare other items online or in a store?","I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon.  I like this so much that this my first product review.  I have to say that I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I would give it a try.  When my husband started grinding it up, I could smell it throughout the house.  Sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste isn't.  However, not with this one.  I'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try.","I love this coffee. I do wish it came already ground as I don't have a grinder and use a blender instead. But it's worth it. Many flavored coffees I've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn't reach the coffee, but this one manages both.","This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time -- I've believe the company is local.  I've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it.  I'm particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good.  I can't say that I've had a bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, it's less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it.  It's a no brainer.  Try it, if you like rich, flavored coffee, you'll like it.","It is hot! I love it, tasty and a little sweet. I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot, but this one lives up to its billing.","I consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  It is hot, but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me; I thought maybe I'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera.  It's hot enough that people who aren't used to it will say \"That's hot!\".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  I don't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A drawback is La Victoria doesn't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sam's Club.  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales.","service was great, but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the sauce - have yet to try the marinade","Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week.  Love this product.  Fast shipping, as usual.  Would buy again.","These individually wrapped pieces are delicious (although I wish there were a few more). Mildly sweet with no sugar-free aftertaste, even a traditional \"marzipan-aholic\" should enjoy these.","Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit.","I was amazed at how quickly it arrived!  It is a cute stocking stuffer, but only OK as far as user appeal.  You get what you pay for.","Toy was typical quality I expected.  I got taken for a major ride on the shipping!","So we cancelled the order.  It was cancelled without any problem.  That is a positive note...","i love the convenience of the singles. The best creamer around.Taste is just like the big bottle. I can stick them in my purse and take them to work.","These creamers come in 4 packs of 25. I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far, and haven't found a single broken or leaking creamer yet. I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee, but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I won't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup. I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping!","Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product. We had no problem with the shipment, but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight. Other than that we are happy :D","Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers, I liked this item specifically because of packaging. I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable.","This seller is very nice.  And the price is very good.  The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free, and at that time he did not have it.  But for those of you that don't have to watch there fat in take, I would get this product from them.","I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee \"tea\" bags.  They're great because they don't require refrigeration.","I received the items in a timely manner. Upon receipt, I removed a pack to consume. The pop-tart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth.","I found these new spring Pop-Tarts and bought them on a whim.  My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun, colorful, amazingly detailed artwork on these Pop-Tarts.  Fantastic for after school snacks, lunch boxes, and school treats. Tie with a ribbon for a bright \"thinking of you this spring\" gift.  The only challenge is finding more in stores.  Way to go Kellogg's - fantastic product!","Yes, I am having a cup right now.  I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee.  I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money. Highly recommend.","Taste like it is stale.  Will not order this again.  I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it.  This stuff tasted NOTHING, like the Douwe Egberts at the hall.  This is possibly stale coffee.","Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent. The product was not. Will not order again. Bad taste. Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes. I throw it right away, i coudl not drink it.","This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land.  It tightens up any dish; not spicy, just perfectly seasoned.  It's perfect, hence, my purchase of this 35 oz. mamma jamma.","The order arrived as advertised. I have had only a few chances to use it, but it is awesome. The flavor is exactly what I hoped for! It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon, but I will definnantly order again!","I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly.  Great quality, flavor and aroma.  Can't beat that its organic!","Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months, and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat.  I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.","I have a slightly different version of this - different brand.  My son started using it around six months, and he really enjoys it.  He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever...  Anyway, I also had trouble cleaning it, until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush.  That works pretty well.  It takes some time, but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender, or cut it up, then clean it up off him, the chair, the floor, the dog, me, well you get the picture.","What a GREAT idea!!!! My daughter love it.&lt;br /&gt;I don't think is difficult to wash, I mean, is not like just toss water and that's it... but, come on!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend it!","This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned.  I couldn't get the food pieces out to save my life. I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests.","I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn't want my new baby to choke on.  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. It worked great for this, as well as for the food. I didn't like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean!","I love, love, love the idea of this product and my little one loves, loves, loves to use it.  She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I don't have to worry about her choking.  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some don't cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.  While I love this product, I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags.","The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product, it's kind of like sucking on food through a cloth. While my daughter was interested in it for a little while, she eventually lost interest. I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts.","This product is amazing. I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them!! Super easy to clean and use. When ordering these, I was under the impression that there were 2 per package...FYI-they're not!! Only one per...","I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding. When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good. I literally had to hide the box to the wedding! They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables. It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I've seen!","\"These are delicious! The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose. Crunchy and not bitter.\"&lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067AD4U\"&gt;Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Pounds&lt;/a&gt;","The product was exactly as advertised and fresh.  Unfortunately, I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast.  We need to reorder to keep up with \"demand\"","These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful!  The chocolate is very dark and rich and the \"bean\" inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing.","Popchips are so good.  I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal.  These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence.  They taste so  good,","I've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix (which is a great product, by the way).  This is the highest price I've seen.  Whole Foods carries this item and it's been on sale there for $9.99 (that's Canadian dollars, too, as I'm in Canada).  It's even cheaper on Baker's Box's own website, and they're the company selling this product through Amazon. For a two-pack they should be charging $20 or less.  What gives?  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices.","The Sugar was sweet, that can not be denied.  As advertised, It didn't melt when baked either.  However, it will not do for your Liege Waffles/Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do.  These grains are smaller, think pretzel salt, or seed pearls.","That's exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes (puffs with small sugar pearls on top). Works great, yum!!","This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.","I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid.","Great stuff and dependable, especially when there are a million brands \"out there\" to choose from.  I love the stuff.  For really high end desires, I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California.  But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again.","I hadn't tried (or heard of) till recently Weavers not it's my favorite. I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and haven't found one yet, they're all so darned smooth. No bite, no after taste, a little pricy but still worth it. No worse price wise than starbucks or peets. Will keep running through the list here and see what happens. Love them all so far.","Having always been a strict Peet's Coffee lover, I was reticent to switch brands but Weaver's won my heart!! The taste is clean and strong, the ethos is correct (organic, baby) and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate. Be still my caffeinated heart!","Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weaver's Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee.  And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they don't know better, take along a travel mug filled with Weaver's coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe.  Er, Weaver's.","A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and/or honey. Definately not my cup of coffee. Oh, did i say it was bitter?","Im learning that Latin American and South American coffees have this distinct \"coffee\" caramelish finish.  As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peet's and we are hooked !  I already reviewd the French and Organic blend, but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink.&lt;br /&gt;Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast.  Since them we are fans.&lt;br /&gt;You wont be dissapointed !","I like eating these whenever I need an energy boost.&lt;br /&gt;It has everything that I am searching for in a, \"To Go Snack\".&lt;br /&gt;Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing!!!","These are my favorite bars ever. The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful! Very filling! These are hard to find in the stores. I'm thankful for subsrcibe and save!","My fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us don't carry them anymore!  Once again, Amazon came through and he couldn't be happier.","I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting, they make a great snack when I'm on the go. Chocolate, peanuts and raisins...it doesn't get any better.","Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school.  He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so.  It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores.  So again, Amazon.com came through with a reasonable price.  Now, I came keep the husband's breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings.  I often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack.","\"Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites.  I was suprised that it was a single box.  every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack.  My fault for not reading closer.  I will not order any more at this price for 1 (24 count)","Green Mountain \"Nantucket Blend\" K-Cups make a very good cup of coffee in my &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA\"&gt;Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK\"&gt;Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging&lt;/a&gt;] I generally drink in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good on both \"Small\" and \"Large\" cup settings as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH","When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors. Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE\"&gt;Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count&lt;/a&gt; to try as well) and see how it goes from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!","Green Mountain is my favorite brand. Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain. Very smooth flavor. Not too strong and not too weak.","I was looking for a replacement for Timothy's Kona Blend which is no longer carried on Amazon.  This coffee from Green Mountain is very nice, but not strong enough for me.  If you like milder coffees, then this one is for you.","One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion,love it for your everyday blend, perfect stregnth, excellent blend!","This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup, the best I have ever eaten, with large hearty chunks of chicken,and vegetables and nice large noodles. This soup is just so full bodied, and is seasoned just right.  I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I just can't find it here in Vermont.","I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking,  I love the regular, I use it on everything. You won't be sorry you tired it, great for dipping bread and cooking omelet, and green beans.","Oh my gosh, is this good!  Like most people, I've been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it.  Then Hubby brought a jar of this home.  The tomato flavor is amazing.  I will never buy store ketchup every again.","Sir Kensington's did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product. The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update, and now leaves me disappointed when I'm given Heinz while out at a restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you Heinz die hard fans out there, this is not the ketchup for you. But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz, be sure to give this Ketchup a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget the spiced variety. Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go.","This is ridiculous.  The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted.  It is pricey, but wow..love this stuff.  It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup.  Yummy!","The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor.  It is clean and really fresh!  Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried.  It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy!","The spicy version of this ketchup isn't bad, but it is too expensive.  The regular version is sweet as dessert.  Horrible.  Annie's Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less.  Even Heinz organic is a better deal.  I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass, not plastic.","These condiments are overpriced and terrible. The classic is disgustingly sweet. The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant.","I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years. The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used, including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA.","I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms. They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend.","If you are a peanut lover, these are for you. Much larger than cocktail peanuts. Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year!!","The cashews were nice and big, with the vast majority being whole.  There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag, but that's pretty expected with so many cashews.  They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order took just over a week to arrive, which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country.  They came double bagged in clear plastic bags, and in two 5 lb portions.  This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price.","Although there were several \"shriveled\" ones, they taste just fine.  I mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they don't have to look perfect anyways.  For the price, they are a great deal (about half of what I find them for in the store)","I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online - even ordering the smaller 1-3oz bags. I will admit, I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good (or bad) the cashews would be...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order came in pretty fast - like 3 days. The cashews were fresh and whole - with like 10 broken pieces. They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape.. first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal; considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them. The trick is to actually keep them in an air-tight box so that they stay fresh longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt $5.00 for the 10lb since I bought them.","These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty.  They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can.","I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants. Plus, he likes nuts, pecans, almonds peanuts. He loved these. I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin, so he could take one to work, or his place, and stay fresh longer. Although I don't think freshness will be an issue, they won't last long......lol","My cat will go for a day, probably longer, haven't tryed it, but he'll walk right by this stuff every time, even when I know he's hungery. ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST. I swear he'd rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it!!","Got this free with another order I placed.  I couldn't believe how much the cats loved it. I will buy again for sure.","This is a great ham soup base.  I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans.  Great flavor","I haven't used the ham base. It is loaded with MSG. I did not realize this when I ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item","Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store.&lt;br /&gt;I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;Just one small secret: Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one.","I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping. This is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture. Thanks again amazon.","Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix.  It tastes great, cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make.  Although it can be made using water, I think it's better made with milk.  I love it with pure organic maple syrup.","The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son's egg allergy.  It's also great for camping or any time you'd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available.","HEY! These are GREAT Waffles and Pancakes! We have to add 50% more mix, tho, as the recipies on the bag are VERY thin. But we have a lot of fun with this Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake &amp; Waffle Mix!

Its handy to have extra bags on hand, too, and you cant beat the Subscribe and save price. This mix is 70% ORGANIC, too!","We are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy.&lt;br /&gt;They taste fine for our family- we like them many ways!","I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess. Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product.","This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping. Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box. 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top. There were no tears in the packages.","Just awful!  I thought food was supposed to taste good!  I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth, it's that bad.","Perhaps the worst bottle of wine I've ever had. I'm not even sure I would cook with this. It is thin, no body, and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot.  The taste is just bitter - not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price. Just not what I'm looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir. Maybe my bottle wasn't sealed well and went to vinegar - other reviews for this wine are favorable.","A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition.  Everyone get the munchies....is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips!","This is a wonderful warm flavored tea, especially now in colder weather.&lt;br /&gt;This tea has a sweet,soothing chamomile fragrance. It is subtle and sweet.It's one of the better chamomile teas.&lt;br /&gt;If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help.&lt;br /&gt;If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend both.","This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup I've ever had so far.  The others pale in flavor by comparison.  There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor.  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale.  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream. There are only 110 calories.  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste, I use it sparingly, so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used.","This is a simple product and it is simply good.  There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are.  It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup, so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out.  This will be great for people who like mint, it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate.  I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half, tastes great.  Sometimes simple is better.","A grande item !  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor, best  ever in a can for all purposes !  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes, and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties !","I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon.  The Raincoast Trading Co. salmon is very tasty, equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland.  However, the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition, the Kirkland cans were dented badly.  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon.","This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant. It's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way, with a lot of water and a bit of milk. This is very creamy and tasty. My only criticism is that there aren't enough sachets in the box. Only 10. Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But it's a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box.","i love this product cant find it locally. Sometimes little out of the way stores have it.But i also love the chicken,pork chop bags.Every store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market.","This is the best way to cook a roast.  Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here.  Please continue to keep this product available!","It's always a pleasure to find French's products on the web.  All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasonings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find.","If you like Oreo's or the Oreo cakester, then you've got to try the Double Stuff cakesters!!! These are the best!! Side note: shipping was very slow, but maybe your chances will be better.","I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this. But out of the can ready mix with a little salt, pepper, spinach, and some cheese and it's a great easy meal!","The thing about Marmite is that those who don't like it hate it, and those who love it can't live without it.  It's very much \"an English thing\" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in \"Victoria Beckham is Marmite\" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.).  Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price.  Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England.  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).  Good job, Amazon!","A vile, miserable pancake. I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried. I don't know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste. Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix. The buttermilk, baking soda (SLS) and sea salt are not. I am going back to Nature's Path Buttermilk pancake mix. This one went straight into the garbage.","Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie! The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast. Hope these don't go the way of the dinosaur!","These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap.  The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies. We ate them all!","I was not expecting to like these cookies as much as I do. I like chocolate chip cookies well enough, but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones. I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around. The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients. The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing. These are truly great cookies.","They aren't fattening and they're good for you, right? That's what I heard, at least, from an admittedly unreliable person.","Great if you are cutting back on fat, they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them. Extremely dry and hard.","I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful. I like the sweet onion chips better, but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. Kettle chips are great chips f/the money!","After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.","I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettle's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt &amp; Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10.","Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10.","one of the best chips that you can buy...and i've tried all the kettle varieties, and many others.  There's only a slight taste of jalapeno, and they are delicious. Perfect with a sandwich or alone.&lt;br /&gt;If you like being addicted, these are the chip for you. ...See you at addicts anonymous...","The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch. We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house, we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite, never enough bags to get us to our next shipment. I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself!!!","WOW!  I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day. Kettle chips are the BEST non-baked chips I have eaten. I decided to try the sweet onion chips, since I've never had them. I now have a FAVORITE!! If you like onions, this is a MUST buy! I will definitely reorder these, as I mentioned above, they are the BEST I have ever eaten! The flavor is GREAT.","I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC\"&gt;Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)&lt;/a&gt; and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.","Now, I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, but these chips still taste like the real deal. These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for. Portion control AND reduced fat? Yes, please!  With the Subscribe &amp; Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store.","I love Kettle Brand Chips!&lt;br /&gt;I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea Salt &amp; Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom &amp; aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips.","These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.  The taste is perfect.  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good.","I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.","I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.","These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).","I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year.I love them,but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite.Will be ordering them.","These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips.  Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it's nice to find ones that I can eat.  The vinegar flavor is really intense and good.","These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and \"spices.\" I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions \"tear here.\" So easy. Why didn't I think of that.","Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.","For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.","Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste.","What I like about them:&lt;br /&gt;1) Very thick chips.&lt;br /&gt;2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.&lt;br /&gt;3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.&lt;br /&gt;4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.","These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many, a handful or two does the trick. Very crisp and savory.","I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt &amp; vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste.","I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!","Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market! These R not too salty or greasy. Great crispy crunch. Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of. Every bag (after bag) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st!!","Kettle chis are the best ever! These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I'm sure this is just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crunchy, real potato chips!","These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning. I like the 2-oz size bags, just the right amount of chips.","I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!","OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)","This was the best deal ever. The delivery was fast, the chips are delicious and very fresh.  Love it:)","My husband and I LOVE these chips! Personally I think the flavor is perfect. Try them for yourself!","The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree.","I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.","As a professional potato chip muncher, I see these as thee very BEST on the market. Rich taste and flavor!! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.The true meaning of decadence!","These are hands-down the absolute best Salt &amp; Vinegar chips you can buy.  They have a great, strong flavor that has left me addicted.  These are certainly my favorite chips.  I highly recommend trying them!","Oh, I love these chips! And they're so hard to find where I am, and when I do find them, they're usually $1-2 more per bag for less. Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon.","I LOVE these chips!  It is a little weird to review potato chips.  But these chips are great. The crunch is just right, plus they have just the right amount of salt. Not to salty not too bland. They are a little oily but that's ok. The best thing is the 2 oz package. When I buy a larger bag it's harder to resist eating them all.  This 2 oz package allows for a little \"portion control\". Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!","In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.","these chips are good, and bad, and create moral dilemmas constantly. If wou are strong at will, or having a large BBQ go for it, but as for me, i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days, had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it. BEWARE","Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.  But this is very simple and delicious.  Probably one of their best flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn't compromise on taste, eco-friendly business that isn't just giving us lip service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open.  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag.  Use scissors instead.","We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation. I wasn't sure what to expect by the package, and at first bite I didn't know what to think...and then all of the flavors hit!&lt;br /&gt;Yum! They are a bit spicy, but nothing overpowering. Just lots of crunchy, sweet, spicy goodness. They aren't sold everywhere though, I'm still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live.","I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive. I can't stop eating them!!! It's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt. Just perfect!!! Believe me, some chips are so salty, I can't finish a small bag. But this one... I just keep on eating!","These are some of the best chips that I have ever had... They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands. They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time! These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time!","I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt &amp; Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\"&gt;Kettle Chips Honey Dijon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\"&gt;Kettle Chips Spicy Thai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"","These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips.

They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag!","These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.  I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close.","They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt &amp; pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime.","It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends.","These are delicious.  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving.","I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of \"brown\" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.","We are always pleased with Amazon's packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken, always fresh. We really liked this brand/flavor of chips. Very tasty!","These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess, don't even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them!","These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected.","fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover","Eat at your own risk.  Once I would open a bag I could not stop.  Good and salty.","I don't eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee.","I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.","Bought this box of chips as a Father's Day gift because Dad loves them.  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.","These chips are quite tasty and the price is right.  Packaged very well, would buy again.","I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy these chips from here again.","For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska!..so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them.  They are very good chips! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing.  I would order groceries online.","My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however.","Just got this order and it is ok. A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me, if it is there.","I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor.","I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\"&gt;Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)&lt;/a&gt;. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.","I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.","I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!","We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and don't feel guilty eating them!  We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money.  We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery.","A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , \"these will change your life!\"  While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you.","But if you happen to, like me, there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip I've found in this country.","These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.","i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them. they are really amazing. i love cheddar too, but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor. i recommend them.","This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had.  Look at the ingredients:  Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper.  How can you go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, not for you if you don't like spicy food. But, if you DO like spicy food, you'll probably love these.  They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food.","Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.","Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.&lt;br /&gt;But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eat&lt;br /&gt;very many. That makes them an indulgence that&lt;br /&gt;rescues some people from overindulgence.","I don't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted.  Every flavor is dynamite.  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing.  And they're healthy!  (besides a lil fat)  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake.  Enjoy, and don't eat them too fast."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Id<\/th>\n      <th>ProductId<\/th>\n      <th>UserId<\/th>\n      <th>ProfileName<\/th>\n      <th>HelpfulnessNumerator<\/th>\n      <th>HelpfulnessDenominator<\/th>\n      <th>Score<\/th>\n      <th>Time<\/th>\n      <th>Summary<\/th>\n      <th>Text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":50,"scrollY":"500px","scrollX":true,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[1,5,6,7,8]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"orderCellsTop":true}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
