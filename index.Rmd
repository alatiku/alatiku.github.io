Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Aliyu Atiku Mustapha, and Iâ€™m a
hard-working professional who is now pursuing a career in the fascinating world
of data science.

My interest in data science was sparked working in the commodity import/export
industry, where I saw firsthand how important data is to comprehending market
trends, patterns, and pricing. This inspired me to go even more deeply into the
world of data analysis.

I eagerly enrolled in the esteemed Google Data Analysis course, honing my skills
in data exploration and extracting valuable insights. Hungry for more knowledge,
I pursued additional classes specializing in leveraging the power of R for data
analysis. As my proficiency in R grew, I found myself increasingly captivated by
the intersection of data science and machine learning. Motivated by this new
found interest, I am currently expanding my expertise in python, with emphasis on machine learning.

As I embark on this career transition, my main objective is to apply my growing
skills to data from the real world. I am motivated to use data science tools to
uncover insightful information, identify trends, and solve complex problems.
I've actively contributed to the Bioconductor project by converting the
["graph"](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/graph.html) and
["OrganismDbi"](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/OrganismDbi.html)
vignettes into HTML versions, enhancing accessibility and usability.

I invite you to explore my personal portfolio projects. All codes are hidden by
default, but can be displayed by clicking the 'Code' button at the top-right
corner of each page and selecting 'Show All Code' or by clicking individual
"Show" buttons along the right-side of the page.

Thank you for visiting!
